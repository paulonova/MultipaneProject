                Passing the container is important in order for the system to apply layout parameters to the root view
                of the inflated layout, specified by the parent view in which it's going.

            3)A boolean indicating whether the inflated layout should be attached to the ViewGroup
            (the second parameter) during inflation. (In this case, this is false because the system
                is already inserting the inflated layout into the containerâ€”passing true would create
                a redundant view group in the final layout.)
